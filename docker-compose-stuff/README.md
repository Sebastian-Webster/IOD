**IMPORTANT**
If you want to clone the repo and run the code, then do docker-compose up --build within the directory.

If you don't want to clone the repo and you just want to run the docker images, download docker-compose.yml from the PUBLIC folder and run docker-compose up within the directory that the docker-compose.yml file is in
